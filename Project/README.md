This directory contains the final project for section 7 ("Ethereum smart contract development using Solidity"), which consists of a simple betting smart contract and associated web interface for interacting with the contract. The smart contract is written in Solidity and the web interface is written in HTML/CSS/JS and JS interacts with the Ethereum blockchain via the Web3 JavaScript APIs.

I've tested the smart contract both by deploying it via Remix and Web3 and interacting with it via the web UI. I deployed the web UI portion of the project locally using NodeJS, Yeoman, the Yeoman WebApp generator, Gulp, and Bower.
