# Udemy-DappDesignAndDevelopment-Section7-Solidity
This repo contains my coding exercise solutions for Section 7 ("Ethereum smart contract development using Solidity") of the Udemy class "Ethereum: Decentralized Application Design and Development" (https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-dapp/learn/v4/content). Each coding exercise covers a specific concept (e.g. exercise 4 covers enums/mappings/structs). All smart contracts are written in Solidity and all tests are written for the Truffle automated test framework. 

There's 1 smart contract for each coding exercise (starting with exercise 3: "Global Variables") and associated Truffle tests. I've also checked in the Truffle deployment file since the tests depend on the smart contracts being deployed with specific constructor argument values. 

All of the tests have been successfully run (i.e. tests complete and pass) via Truffle 3.4.7 against TestRPC. 

The tests require NodeJS, Truffle, and TestRPC (which is included with Truffle).
