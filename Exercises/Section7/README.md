The goal of the section 7 coding exercises is to implement a simple betting smart contract, with each exercise being targeted at a specific concept (e.g. exercise 4 covers enums/mappings/structs). All smart contracts are written in Solidity and all tests are written for the Truffle automated test framework.

I've included the Truffle deployment file since the tests depend on the smart contracts being deployed with specific constructor argument values.
